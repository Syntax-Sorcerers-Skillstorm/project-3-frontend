# Quiz Application
## Objective
Clicking on a quiz routes the user to another page where the user can either start the selected quiz or navigate back to the quiz list page.
Selecting start quiz displays the questions relevant to the quiz (pulled from the database and filtered).
Upon finishing all of the questions, the user can click submit. The application confirms if the user really wants to submit, warning them they will not be able to go back and edit their selections.
Upon submission, the user is navigated to a results page to see the grade for their exam attempt. Grading is done on the backend to avoid making the answers publicly available on the frontend.
From the results page, the user can navigate back to the quiz list page and begin again.
The application considers possible edge cases such as the quiz being submitted with unanswered questions or the user attempting to navigate to quizzes and pages that don’t exist.
